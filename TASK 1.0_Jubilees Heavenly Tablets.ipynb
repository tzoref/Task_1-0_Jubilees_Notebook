    "# TASK 1: Locate, compile, and process references to citations of “Heavenly Tablets” in the Book of Jubilees\n",

    "This is the first of a series of notebooks that contain the computational tasks for analyzing references to \"Heavenly Tablets\" in the Book of Jubilees and associated texts in the Hebrew Bible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores references to the “Heavenly Tablets” in the Book of Jubilees. Particularly, we consider several “computational tasks” as steps in the analysis of these references, comparing and integrating conventional biblical studies approaches and methods, with computational approaches and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Ethiopic text of the Book of Jubilees as our primary source for Jubilees, both in the Ge'ez and in translation, as this is the most complete text, containing the 50 known chapters, and because comparison with Greek versions and Hebrew manuscript evidence from Qumran confirms its reliability as a witness for ancient versions, for overlapping portions of text.\n",

    "We use J.C. VanderKam's critical text in Ge'ez and his English translation, from: https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/festival-and-fast-day-readings/jewish-readings/shavuot-readings/sefer-hayovelim-jubilees-preserved-in-geez/. We work primarily with the English text, bringing Ge'ez, and Greek or Hebrew, where relevant.
